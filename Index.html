        <h1>Moving To America</h1>
        
        <p>First thing to figure out is why do you want to move to America? Aside from American movies dominating the big screen and making the country seem oh so cool. Is it for practical reason like increasing one's financial potential? If so let's take a look at why America is considered to be a holy ground for financial growth and are there any other countries that might be in closer vicinity to you that might offer the same promise of growth?
           This takes us to the G7 Countries. The <em class="embed">G7</em> countries are:  United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, Japan and Germany. These seven countries having the largest industrial economies. This means jobs and commerce for those who can work and or trade. Depending on what region of the world you are living one of these G7 countries might be closer to you. Take into consideration the countries native language against your own. Are you willing to learn the countries native language for ease of living? <img src="https://www.electiontamasha.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Untitled-design-7-1.png" alt="List of G7 countries are: USA,UK,Canada,Japan,France,Germany and Italy" class="medium left">
           Now if America is still your destination of choice let's delve into the meat of the matter now and learn how to move to America. First thing is you must have the required documents and valid reason to move to America be it a loved one that will help you move, family or a job? Otherwise you might just be able to solely visit America.
           <br><p>Do not despair if you are one of entrepeneurial ways this is just right for you. You can apply for a business visa. Then to honor and keep your visa ensure that you pay close attention to the time alloted for your stay in the United States and go back and forth as stated by the US customs and border protection.Now to do legal business in the USA as a foreigner you need an ITIN. <img src="https://www.itin-w7-application.com/wp-content/themes/iconic-one/img/itin-w7_logo.png" alt= "logo showing the acronym I T I N" class= "medium right"></p><br> <p> Now with an ITIN you can set up your business, receive payments and pay government taxes on your earnings.You might be coming to America because your spouse is an American citizen or green card holder. To come over this way your spouse and you will have to fill out forms issued by the USCIS.<br> <p>Now you can always visit America as a tourist, for this type of travel to the US you will have to fill out a form called the DS-160 which you can acquire online or perhaps at a local police station as is done in Jamaica. To travel to the USA is great for holidays as there are many historical Western world sites to view. Watch the video below of me enjoying the view of the Hoover Dam in Nevada USA and as well as narating information about the hydroelectricity that is generated at this historical dam.<video src="C:\Users\petro\OneDrive\Documents\2047601173749679886_60830839_1036892783174428_6690092672318701568_n.mp4" class="video" autoplay controls> </video>
